## âœ” Premise
It's in My DNA is a fun web app where a user can enter their 10-character DNA code (real or not) and find matches with other users that supplied their own code.

Most of your DNA sequence is identical to every other human on the planet. However, certain locations in our DNA sequence are of special interest. These locations, called genetic markers, can be used to uniquely identify someone, predict the likelihood of a genetic disorder, or help trace ancestry through time.

In the case of genealogy, we are most interested in the genetic markers that are the most conserved. In other words, those sections of DNA that remain relatively constant in each generation.

For tracing ancestry, genetic genealogy services such as Family Tree DNA and 23andMe use between 20 and 700,000 different markers that vary in length between 1 and 300 nucleotide each. By using these services, someone can find long-lost cousins that share the same paternal or maternal ancestry.
